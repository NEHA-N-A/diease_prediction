# Disease Prediction Model Using NLP

## Introduction
This project includes two parts:
1. *Data Analysis*: Analyzing the data using various techniques to find insights.
2. *NLP Model*: Creating a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that predicts the disease based on the symptoms provided as input and suggests the procedure and medication for the predicted disease.

## Dataset Description
I have gathered data related to various diseases and combined the necessary symptoms of each into a single CSV file for the data analysis part. Additionally, I have derived the symptoms of each disease in text format to support the NLP algorithm. The dataset includes training and testing data for six diseases. 

## Installation
I have attached the code file for analysis in JSON format, which is accessible in the Visual Studio Code Jupyter notebook environment.

## Usage
Kindly run the kernel and execute the code to obtain a comprehensive analysis of the data. The code for the prediction model should be combined with the source path of the file named disease_big_data.csv.

## Project Structure
The project directory is organized as follows:
  1. ANALYSIS DATA.csv
  2. PREDICTION MODEL DATA.xlsx
  3. disease symptoms analysis.ipynb
  4. disease_prediction_NLP.py

## Summary
We have derived insights for each disease and its most common symptom. For example:
- The most common symptom of *Corona* is cough.
- The most common symptom of *Alzheimer's* is memory loss.
- The most common symptom of *Breast Cancer* is nipple discharge.
- The most common symptom of *Brain Tumor* is fatigue.

In the prediction model, we have implemented NLP so that when a symptom is entered, the model predicts the disease and provides the procedure to be followed and medication recommendations.
