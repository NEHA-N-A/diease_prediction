# Disease Prediction Model Using NLP

## Introduction
This project includes two parts:
1. *Data Analysis*: Analyzing the data using various techniques to find insights.
2. *NLP Model*: Creating a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that predicts the disease based on the symptoms provided as input and suggests the procedure and medication for the predicted disease.

## Dataset Description
I have gathered data related to various diseases and combined the necessary symptoms of each into a single CSV file for the data analysis part. Additionally, I have derived the symptoms of each disease in text format to support the NLP algorithm. The dataset includes training and testing data for six diseases. The links to the datasets are available below.

## Installation
I have attached the code file for analysis in JSON format, which is accessible in the Visual Studio Code Jupyter notebook environment.

## Usage
Kindly run the kernel and execute the code to obtain a comprehensive analysis of the data. The code for the prediction model should be combined with the source path of the file named disease_big_data.csv.

## Project Structure
The project directory is organized as follows:
